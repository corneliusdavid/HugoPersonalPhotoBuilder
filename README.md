# Hugo Personal Photo Builder
A Delphi program to collect parameters that fill an _index.md file for building a photo website using the [Hugo](https://github.com/kc0bfv/autophugo) framework and the [AutoPhugo](https://github.com/kc0bfv/autophugo) theme.

This started off as [simple Go program](https://gist.github.com/corneliusdavid/b7c99b08fec031bc9b5164f2041183b1), running on the command-line and it worked. But I wanted a GUI application because I have a LOT of photos to put in our personal photo album and creating albums one command-line at a time was tedious and time-consuming.

So, I converted the Go console program to a Delphi console program. Then took the functional parts of that and created a FireMonkey app. The first version of this is simply to get it to run on either a Windows or Mac desktop but eventually, I would like to make a mobile version that I can use on my Android phone to access new pictures I take and add them instantly to my website

Big plans!!
